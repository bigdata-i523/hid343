    abstract: Technology is starting to change the way of industrial operations since the competitiveness is getting more prominent for companies their quality metrics and tolerances are getting smaller every day to make the quality items. We will explain the importance of essential data applications in manufacturing operations. These operations are consist of supply chain associated with manufacturing, intelligence systems in manufacturing, leverage of Big Data applications, as well as intelligence systems in factory processes.

    review: Dec 4 2017
    abstract: This project takes a closer look to some of the most used supervised learning algorithms in machine learning. We start with the description of the each of the algorithms then we move it to analytics and findings by using that particular algorithm in our data-set. We also provide advantages and disadvantages of each supervised machine learning algorithm for future reference. We mainly focus on our prediction of the income level of individuals by looking at their age, gender, education, location, and other features given by our data-set. We will try each algorithm and try to pick the best features from our data-set to have an optimal prediction.
