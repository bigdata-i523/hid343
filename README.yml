    abstract: Technology is starting to change the way of industrial operations since the competitiveness is getting more prominent for companies their quality metrics and tolerances are getting smaller every day to make the quality items. We will explain the importance of essential data applications in manufacturing operations. These operations are consist of supply chain associated with manufacturing, intelligence systems in manufacturing, leverage of Big Data applications, as well as intelligence systems in factory processes.
